This module adds a filter on product attributes so that they can be removed from the Point of Sale product configurator popup. It can be useful for instance if some attributes are only needed for the website.


.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
