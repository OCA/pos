            There hasn't been any activity on this issue in the past 6 months, so it has
            been automatically marked as stale and it will be closed automatically if no
            further activity occurs in the next 30 days.

            If you think this is a mistake and want to keep the issue open, please ask a
            PSC member to mark it as "no stale".

            past 60 days. It will be automatically closed in 30 days unless there's some
            activity.
