This module extends the functionality of odoo Point Of Sale to reduce creation
time of the PoS orders, via the front UI.

For that purpose, it delays the creation of the picking associated, that will
be created later by queue job.

This module is interesting specially in a context of Synchroneous Point Of
Sale that is introduced by certification modules like 'l10n_fr_pos_cert' because
in such cases, the bill will be printed only when the pos order is created (
after the call of the function create_from_ui) and the creation of the picking
is the process that takes the most time.

See https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/26314#issuecomment-422949266
for more information.

Configuration
=============

* Go to 'Point of Sale' / 'Configuration' / 'Point of Sale'
* Select your Point of Sale
* Set the value in the field 'Picking Creation Delayed'. (Checked by default)

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pos_picking_delayed/static/description/pos_config_form.png

* This module depends on ``queue_job`` module that requires specific
  configuration to works properly. Make sure your config file is correctly set.
  See https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/12.0/queue_job

You should update your ``odoo.cfg`` file to add a new channel named
``root.pos_picking_delayed``:


.. code-block::

  [queue_job]
  channels = root:2,root.pos_picking_delayed:1

Otherwise, you'll have a non blocking warning in your log, like this one.

.. code-block::

  WARNING ? odoo.addons.queue_job.jobrunner.channels: unknown channel root.pos_picking_delayed, using root channel for job 23f6b872-1d2c-4003-bd38-a8486bbec664

Usage
=====

* Use your Point of Sale as usual. When validating an order, the order will
  be in a different color until the job is executed
