Use Cases / Context
===================

In case there is a structure of pricelists with lines using "Formula: Based on" (eg: Pricelist 3 is based on Pricelist 2 which is based on Pricelist 1) they all need to be added in "Available pricelists" for POS to load correctly.

Usage
=====

In POS configuration, enable advanced pricelists and add all pricelists with reference to pricelists to be used in POS in "Available Pricelists".

To restrict POS user from selecting any pricelist (therefore only use prices from "Default Pricelist"), enable boolean "Hide Pricelist Button"

To restrict POS user's pricelist selection to a set of pricelists, add them to "Selectable Pricelists".
Note: make sure "Default Pricelist" is among "Selectable Pricelists".
