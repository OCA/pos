POS Remove POS Category
=======================

This module was written to replace POS categories by product categories
in the point of sale.

Important notes
---------------
- When the module is installed the link beetween products and POS categories
  is **overwritten** by a link beetween products and product categories
  (the link is the field pos_categ_id in the table product_template)
- When the module is uninstalled the link beetween products and POS categories
  is restored in an **empty** state (NULL values)

Installation
============

This module depends on the `point_of_sale` Odoo official module.

Configuration
=============

No configuration is needed just use product categories as standard
pos categories.
You may uncheck 'Available in the Point of Sale' field
