This module is a backport from Odoo SA and as such, it is not included in the OCA CLA. That means we do not have a copy of the copyright on it like all other OCA modules.

This module extends the functionality of Point of Sale (point_of_sale) and makes it possible to carry out the Cash In/Cash Out process directly through the POS. Also implement the functionality of closing the session via the front-end through the control box.
