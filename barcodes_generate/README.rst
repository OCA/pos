============================================
Generate Barcodes for Products and Customers
============================================

This module expends Odoo functionnality, allowing user to generate barcode
depending on a given barcode rule.

For exemple, a typical pattern for products is  "23.....{NNNDD}" that means
that:
* the EAN13 code will begin by '23'
* followed by 5 digits (named Barcode Base in this module)
* and after 5 others digits to define the variable price
* a 13 digit control

With this module, it is possible to:

* Affect a pattern (barcode.rule) to a product.product or a res.partner

* Generate the next Barcode base of a pattern. (to avoid duplicate barcode)

* Generate a barcode, based on a pattern and a barcode base

Installation
============

This module use an extra python librairy named 'pyBarcode' you should install
to make barcode generation works properly.

sudo pip install pyBarcode

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Point Of Sale / Configuration / Barcode Nomenclatures and select
* Select a Nomenclature
* Create or select a rule
.. image:: /barcodes_generate/static/description/barcode_rule_tree.png

* Check 'Available for Products', or 'Available for Partners' Checkbox.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to a Product form (or a Partner Form):
* set a rule to the current object

.. image:: /barcodes_generate/static/description/product_product_form_generate_base_barcode.png

* Click on 'Generate Base and Barcode'

.. image:: /barcodes_generate/static/description/product_product_form_generated.png


Alternatively you can set manually a barcode base, and click only on Generate barcode.

Inheritance
===========

If you want to generate barcode for another model, you can create a custom
module that inherits on 'barcodes_generate' and inherit your model like that:

class MyModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'my.model'
    _inherit = ['my.model', 'barcode.generate.mixin']

class barcode_rule(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'barcode.rule'

    generate_model = fields.Selection(selection_add=[('my.model', 'My Model')])

Finally, you should inherit your model view adding buttons and fields.

Note
----

Your model should have a field 'barcode' defined.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

1. Dependency to point_of_sale is required because barcode field, defined in 'base'
module (in the res.partner model), is defined in a 'point_of_sale' view.
Furthermore, barcode nomenclature menu is available on Point Of Sale submenu.

It's a relative problem, because product barcodes generation will occures
mostly in a Point of Sale context.

You could comment 'point_of_sale' dependencies if you want to use this module
without point of sale installed.

2. On barcode.rule model, constraint and domain system could be set between
'type' and 'generate_model' fields.
