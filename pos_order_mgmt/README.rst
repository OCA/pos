This module extends the functionality of the PoS frontend allowing to load
already done PoS Orders in order to be able to operate over them, being able to
reprint past tickets or return them.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to *Point of Sale > Configuration >
Point of Sale* and enable *Order Management*

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/13.0/pos_order_mgmt/static/description/order-mgmt-config.png

#. Change *Maximum orders to load* to your desired amount (10 by default).
   Please note that the more you load, the more it will take to load
   them in the session opening. You can also set it to 0 and you'll just be
   able to load them from the order list screen.

#. Enable *Reprint orders* on if you want to be able to reprint past orders
   in that PoS.

#. Enable *Return orders* on if you want to be able to return past orders
   in that PoS.

#. Enable *Duplicate orders* on if you want to be able to return past orders
   in that PoS.

Usage
=====

Once the PoS is loaded, you'll find a shopping trolley icon (🛒) in the top
bar that grants access to the order list screen.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/13.0/pos_order_mgmt/static/description/order-mgmt-icon.png

There you can find the number of past orders loaded according to your
configuration (see Configuration) as well as the orders you checked out in
the current session:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/13.0/pos_order_mgmt/static/description/order-mgmt-list.png

#. You can see their totals as well as their custumers if registered.
#. You can reprint their tickets clicking on the printer icon (⎙).
#. You can return them pressing on the arrow icon (↶).
#. You have a search input as well that lets you find past tickets by its
   reference number.

NOTE: You'll need your PoS to be online to be able to search or return a past
ticket.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module contains a *basic return* feature that makes possible returning
  the same order over and over. If you need a full return feature, you can
  install ``pos_order_return`` (only back office implementation), or
  ``pos_order_return_traceability``, which also covers front office support.
