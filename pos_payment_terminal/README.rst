Installation
============

This module is designed to be installed on the
*main Odoo server*. On the *POSbox/IoTbox*, you should install the module
*hw_x* depending on the protocol implemented in your device. Remember that the POSbox/IoTbox runs Odoo v12 (even if your Odoo server runs v13 or v14), so you should look in the 12.0 branch of the `OCA POS project <https://github.com/OCA/pos>`_ to find the *hw_x* modules.

`Ingenico <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenico>`
card readers for France support the Telium protocol implemented in the
*hw_telium_payment_terminal* module for the POSbox/IoTBox.

You can also consider `pywebdriver project <https://github.com/akretion/pywebdriver>`_ as an alternative to the POSbox/IoTbox.

Configuration
=============

* Go to *Point of Sale > Configuration > Payment Methods*, edit the
  payment method corresponding to the card reader and set
  the field *Use a payment terminal* to *OCA Payment Terminal*. A new field *Payment Mode* will appear, that has *Card* as defaut value. If the payment method is for Checks and you have a check printer, select *Check* instead.

Usage
=====

In the frontend of the POS, when you select a payment method that has a payment mode with *Use a Payment Terminal* set to *OCA Payment Terminal*, you will have an additionnal *Send* button: if you click on that button, the amount, the currency and the payment mode will be sent to the POSbox/IoTBox/pywebdriver.
