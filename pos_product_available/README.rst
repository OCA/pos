Point of Sale - Products Available for each POS
================

Description
===========

This module is responsible for assigning the products available for sale to each Point of Sale. 
To assign the products to each Point of Sale, a new configuration has been added to the products to set the Points of Sale where they can be sold.

Configuration
=============

In the configuration of each product, in the Point of Sale section, there is a new option where you can assign all the Points of Sale where it should be available.
To configure each Point of Sale to only display the products that have been assigned to it, you will need to go into the Point of Sale settings and activate the option called "Available products". Once activated, all the products that are configured to appear at that Point of Sale will be listed below.
