In points of sale that share a category with the "Restrict product categories" option, not all products in said categories must necessarily be sold.

In some points of sale you can sell some products that are not available in another point of sale even though they share the category.

To do this, this module has been created that gives the option to put in each product, in which points of sale they are visible, for these products to 
appear in the points of sale, this point of sale must have configured that said category be displayed. of the products.
