In some use cases, one may want to centralize the communication with
payment terminal on a same place
(e.g.: for deployment/infrastructure requirements).

This module allows to create a new communication tunnel between
Odoo POS and a centralized payment terminal server.

This implementation allows too to use classical 'PosBox' flow for other
interfaces (barcode, scale, printer, ...).
