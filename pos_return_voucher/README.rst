This module extends the functionality of the PoS by allowing the issuance of
discount vouchers (both fronted and backend) when a return is made. This means
that the customer receives a ticket with a barcode that can be redeemed for the
amount of the return during the time configured in the POS (in days).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

In addition, yo need to go to *Point of Sale > Configuration > Point of Sale*
and indicate the time (in days) of validity of the return vouchers issued (
you can leave this option empty and the vouchers will have an indefinite date,
i.e. they will never expire.). And add previous payment method created.

Usage
=====

- Emitt Return Voucher

Once the PoS is loaded, you'll find a magnifying glass icon (ðŸ”Ž) in the top
bar that grants access to the order list screen. here you can find the number
of past orders loaded according to your configuration
(see `pos_order_mgmt` module).

Once in the return payment screen, select the payment method configured with
the "Return Voucher" flag.

When the payment is validated, the ticket will appear together with a barcode
that the customer can use for his next purchase.

- Redeem Return Voucher

Once the POS has loaded, when the customer places a new order, on the payment
screen the payment method marked with the "Return Voucher" flag can be selected,
when this is selected the user must scan the barcode. Once read, the discount
voucher info will be displayed.
