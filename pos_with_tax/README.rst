Product prices in POS with taxes
================================

This addon shows the correct price indepently of the tax configuration
(with or without the "Tax included in price" check)

It takes care of tax configuration: price_include, showing prices
with tax included even "Tax included in price" is checked (price_include == True)
or unchecked (price_include == False)

This helps to shop owner because he can set product prices with or without taxes,
but prices are always shown in POS with taxes
