Configuration
=============

Go to *Point of Sale > Configuration > Point of Sale* and enable *Sell Events*
on the desired PoS.

Optionally, you can choose to filter on a list of Event Types.

Enable *Available in PoS* on all event products related to event tickets you
want to sell in PoS. If the ticket product is not available on the pos,
the ticket won't be available neither.

Usage
=====


- Click on the Add Event button, or on any Event product.
