Sell events tickets from the Point of Sale

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Go to *Point of Sale > Configuration > Point of Sale* and enable *Sell Events*
on the desired PoS.

Optionally, you can choose to filter on a list of Event Types.

Enable *Available in PoS* on all event products related to event tickets you
want to sell in PoS. If the ticket product is not available on the pos,
the ticket won't be available neither.

Usage
=====


- Click on the Add Event button, or on any Event product.

- Use the calendar widget to filter the events, and click on one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================


* Add more test tours, specially ones that check availabilities.

* Handle event registration details. It could be another popup right
  before going to payment (similar to core `event_sale` workflow).

* Cancel registrations when the PoS order are refunded, possibly in a separate
  module depending on `pos_order_return` to get the reference of the `refunded_order_id`.

* Possibly add an option to print the event badges from the Point of Sale.
