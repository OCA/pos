This module allows the use of deposit products for PoS products.

An example of such a deposit product would be a bottle of cola, where the bottle is
being sold for an extra 25 cents, which you get back when you bring the bottle back to
the store intact. Whenever the cola is added to a PoS order, the bottle is added too.
If the cola quantity changes, the bottle quantity will change as well.
