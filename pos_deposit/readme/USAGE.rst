To use this module, open a POS session and:

#. When a deposit product (eg. cola) is added, the bottle is added to the
   order as well and the quantities are kept in sync.

#. When someone brings back bottles to the store, you can just add a bottle
   and enter a negative sale quantity, thus refunding the bottle.
