This module allows the use of deposit products for PoS products.

An example of such a deposit product would be a bottle of cola, where the bottle is
being sold for an extra 25 cents, which you get back when you bring the bottle back to
the store intact. Whenever the cola is added to a PoS order, the bottle is added too.
If the cola quantity changes, the bottle quantity will change as well.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to *Point of Sale > Products*.

#. Select or add at least one 'deposit product', such as 'Bottle 1L',
   with a non-zero price and with the checkbox 'Is Deposit' set to True.

#. Select or add at least one product of which 'Use Deposit' is checked,
   such as '1 liter of cola'. In the accompanying product selection field,
   select the bottle. The two products are now linked.

Usage
=====

To use this module, open a POS session and:

#. When a deposit product (eg. cola) is added, the bottle is added to the
   order as well and the quantities are kept in sync.

#. When someone brings back bottles to the store, you can just add a bottle
   and enter a negative sale quantity, thus refunding the bottle.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- If the screen refreshes or session is reopened, the link between product and container is lost, so the quantities can get out of sync. This is not something that happens often and can be 'repaired' by removing and re-adding a product to the order.
