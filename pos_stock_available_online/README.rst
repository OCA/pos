This module allows to display product quantities in selected locations in real time. Quantities are displayed directly on product tiles:
  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_stock_available_online/static/img/pos_quantity.png

Once a product quantity is changed it will be simultaneously updated in all active POS.

This module depends on stock_available module which is available in https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-availability repo.

Configuration
=============

In "Point of Sale" configuration "Product Quantity" section activate "Display Product Quantity" feature:
  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_stock_available_online/static/img/pos_config.png

By default quantity is displayed for the warehouse that is used in the POS stock operation type.

You can add additional warehouses to show quantity in by adding them into "Additional Warehouses" field.

In this case the following information will be displayed on product tiles:

- Total quantity = quantity in the default warehouse + quantity in the additional warehouses

- Quantity in the default warehouse

- Quantity in the additional warehouses.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module requires connection to update quantities and doesn't support offline mode.
Warehouses must belong to the same company as POS.
Offline mode support (probably additional module).
