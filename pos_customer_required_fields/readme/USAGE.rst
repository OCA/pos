Create new Custom Required Field. You can select one or multiple from the list:

["street","city","zip","state_id","country_id","lang","email","phone","barcode", "vat"]

Only these fields are editable in the customer form of the POS. Name is required by default.

Assign to which user groups this field is going to be required.

Go to POS -> Customer -> Select any line -> EDIT.

Leave required field empty.

Try to save. You will see error, saying that field is required.
