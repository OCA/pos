This module would allow use to split a pos.order in two moves.

The first one will be payed inside the PoS Order, and the second one
will be payed after by this secondary partner.

This approach might appear in several cases, mainly on co-payments
(Medical centers, Pharmacies...)

The pricelists created with split method shouldn't be used on Sale
Orders, as they are only supported with pos orders made in the pos UI.

Configuration
=============

Before using this module, you need to define pricelists with "Advanced
price rules" in point of sale settings (Pricing section).

After that, you need to create a Pricelist with a Splitting partner
configured and a rule with type **Split Invoice**. On that rule you need
to set the base pricelist used to compute the total price, the pricelist
used to split and the amount payed by the splitting partner.

For example, if we have a Product with a Pricelist A of 100 and a
Pricelist B of 80, and we specify the price computation "Based on"
Pricelist A and "Split amount based on" Pricelist B with "Split
percentage" of 90%, the final amount payed by the Customer will be: 100
- 80*90% = 28.

All the pricelists involved in the calculations (including the "Based
on") must be included on the Point Of Sale Configuration in order to
proceed properly.

Usage
=====

Change the amount pricelist of products to a splitting one and the
amount will be correctly computed on PoS.

After PoS validation, the invoice to the splitting partner will be
created.
