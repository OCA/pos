Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo allows to configure warnings for partners and products to be shown
when a new sales order is created.

However those warnings will not be shown for a POS order.

Configuration
=============

This module requires "sale_management" module to be installed.

When installed go to the "Settings/Sales" menu and scroll to the
"Quotations & Orders" section.

Activate the "Sale Warnings" checkbox.

Usage
=====

On a partner form open the "Internal Notes" tab, and select a message
type in the "WARNING ON THE SALES ORDER" field. Add the warning text to
be shown in the field below.

When this partner is selected in POS a warning will be shown. Depending
on the warning type it can be a blocking or a non-blocking one.

Known issues / Roadmap
