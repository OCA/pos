This module allow to define some reasons for the functionality of
"Put Money In" and "Take Money Out" available in point of sale session.

So, with this module it's possible to impact directly an expense or income
account which is defined on the related reasons and create according
accounting entries.

**Typical Use Case (not exhaustive)**

* You want to track **Bank deposit** moves, using an intermediate
  bank account named 'Cash Awaiting Bank Deposit'.
  (In France, for instance, "581 - Espèce en attente d'encaissement")

* You want to allow payments from Cash Journal to pay recurring
  little expenses. (Gasoline, parking meter, etc.)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

As it is not possible to disable actions on Odoo, a new technical group is
added by this module, named 'Use Old PoS 'Put or Take Money' Actions', to
hide native obsolete actions available on the model ``pos.session``
(the two buttons "Take Money Out" and "Put Money In")

Changelog
=========

12.0.3.0.0 (2019-08-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [MIG] Port module to version 12.0.

  Use instead a new model ``pos.move.reason`` for this purpose.
* [REF] Doesn't inherit from ``cash.box.in`` and ``cash.box.out`` model,
  as there are bad designed and doesn't allow clean inheritance.
  Instead, use new transient model ``wizard.pos.move.reason``.
