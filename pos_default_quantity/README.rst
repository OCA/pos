This module adds a field for a default quantity to Unit of Measure Categories.
When this is filled in, and when this functionality is enabled in the Point of
Sale configuration, then adding that product to an order in the Point of Sale
will set the quantity to that value by default.

- For each relevant unit of measure category, determine a default product quantity
  (default: 1).
