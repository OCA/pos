This module extends the functionality of point of sale to allow you to
load your pickings in the Point of Sale, in order to add / remove products
and so create a PoS Order and mark it as paid.

**Detailled Use Case**

This module is usefull for the following use case

* You have many Sale Orders that have generated pickings. Typically if you have
  connected your Odoo instance to an online store like Shop Invader,
  Prestashop, Magento, or if you use light Odoo shop (``website_sale``
  module).
* Once the order validated, you prepare your pickings
* The customer come in your shop to recover his order
* the customer add (or remove) some products
* the customer pay his order, based on the real delivered products list

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to Warehouse / Configuration / Types of Operation
#. Select the picking type(s) you want to see in the point of sale
#. Check the box 'Available in Point of Sale'

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/stock_picking_type_form.png
   :width: 800 px

Note: This box is NOT enabled by default except in demo data for the type
'Delivery Orders' of the demo company 'YourCompany'.

#. Go to Point of Sale / Configuration / Point of Sales
#. Select the Point(s) of Sales witch those you want to enable the feature
#. Check the box 'Load Pickings'
#. Set the max quantity of pickings you want to load

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/pos_config_form.png
   :width: 800 px

Note: This box is enabled by default

**Technical Notes**

* By default, the Point of Sale will display only the pickings if the state is
  in  'Waiting Availability', 'Partially Available' or 'Ready to Transfer'.

You can change this filter by overloading the ``_prepare_filter_for_pos``
function of the model ``stock.picking``.

* By default, the search of pickings will be done on the fields ``name``,
  ``origin`` and ``partner_id`` of the picking.

You can change this feature by overloading the
``_prepare_filter_query_for_pos`` function of the model ``stock.picking``.

* By default, when the PoS order is confirmed, the original picking is
  cancelled and the sale order is set to the state 'Done'.

You can change this behaviour by overloading
``_handle_orders_with_original_picking`` function of the model ``pos.order``.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Launch the point of sale
* On a new order (without lines), click on the 'Load Picking' button.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/load_picking_01_load_button.png
   :width: 800 px

* Point of sale will load available pickings. (About displayed pickings, see
  'Technical Notes' section).

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/load_picking_02_picking_list.png
   :width: 800 px

* Click on a picking will check if the picking is loadable and if yes, will
  display a 'Select' button. (See 'Possible Warnings' Section)

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/load_picking_03_confirm.png
   :width: 800 px

* Confirm the selection, by clicking on 'Select' button. It will display
  the content of the moves (as PoS Order Lines)

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_picking_load/static/description/load_picking_04_pos_order.png
   :width: 800 px

The price and the discount will be the sale price and the discount set in
the according Sale Order Line, if it was found. Otherwise, discount will be
set to 0, and unit price will be the unit price of the product when it has been
loaded in the Point of Sale.

   :width: 800 px


* Finally, you can add / remove products or change quantity and collect the
  payment.

When, the order is marked as paid, the original picking will be cancelled,
because Point Of Sale generates a new picking related to the real delivered
products and the original Sale Order will pass to the state 'Done'. (Delivery
exception is ignored).
(See 'Technical Notes' section).

**Possible Warnings**

Some warning messages can appear:

* if some products are not available in the Point of Sale

* if the partner is not available in the Point of Sale

* if the picking has been still loaded in another PoS order

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module will try to get original unit price from the sale order and not
  use the Current unit price of the product.
  (The price at which you pledged to sell the product).
  Some VAT troubles will occure if a product is set with VAT marked as
  'VAT included' and if in the sale order line, there are some VAT marked as
  'VAT excluded' for exemple.

**The VAT settings should be consistent.**
