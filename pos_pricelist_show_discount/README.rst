This module allows to display in POS interface the discount applied to customer, calculated as difference between POS final price and price from a specific pricelist set in POS configuration.


This can be useful to provide customer an explicit reference of the discount applied from a "standard" pricelist, without the need to have the the POS pricelist based on the "standard" pricelist.

Configuration
=============

Set the discount pricelist to use as reference in the pos configuration page.

Usage
=====

In general configuration, enable Pricelists

In POS configuration:

- enable "Advanced Pricelists" and add your reference pricelist to "Available pricelists"

- enable "Display Discount From Reference Pricelist" and select a reference pricelist


In POS interface, reference pricelist price and discount applied is displayed if POS price is lower than reference pricelist price.
