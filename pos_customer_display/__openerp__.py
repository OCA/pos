POS Customer Display
====================

This module adds support for Customer Display in the Point of Sale. This module is designed to be installed on the *main Odoo server*. On the *POSbox*, you should install the module *hw_customer_display*.

The number of rows and cols of the Customer Display (usually 2 x 20) should be configured on the main Odoo server, in the menu Point of Sale > Configuration > Point of Sales.

It has been tested with a Bixolon BCD-1100 (http://www.bixolon.com/html/en/product/product_detail.xhtml?prod_id=61), but should support most serial and USB-serial LCD displays out-of-the-box or with inheritance of a few functions. To setup the BCD-1100 on Linux, you will find some technical instructions on this page : http://techtuxwords.blogspot.fr/2012/12/linux-and-bixolon-bcd-1100.html

This module has been developped during a POS code sprint at Akretion France from July 7th to July 10th 2014. This module is part of the POS project of the Odoo Community Association http://odoo-community.org/. You are invited to become a member and/or get involved in the Association !

Please contact Alexis de Lattre from Akretion <alexis.delattre@akretion.com> for any help or question about this module.
