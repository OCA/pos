This module adds support for LED Customer Display in the Point of Sale.

It has been tested with

* Bixolon BCD-1100 (http://www.bixolon.com/html/en/product/product_detail.xhtml?prod_id=61),
* Aures OCD 300 (https://www.aures.com/point-de-vente-equipment-solutions-systemes/ecrans-tactiles-afficheurs/ocd-300-350-afficheur-client-graphique)

But it should support most serial and USB-serial LED displays out-of-the-box or with minor adaptations in the source code
* of the module *hw_customer_display* if you use the POSbox,
* or of the Python lib `pyposdisplay <https://github.com/akretion/pyposdisplay>`__ if you use `pywebdriver <https://github.com/akretion/pywebdriver>`__.

Installation
============

This module is designed to be installed on the *main Odoo server*. On the
*POSbox*, you should install the module *hw_customer_display*. But you will certainly prefer to use `pywebdriver <https://github.com/akretion/pywebdriver>`__ instead of the POSbox. Compared to the POSbox, Pywebdriver has several advantages:

* smaller footprint: no need to have a full-blown Odoo with PostgreSQL on the computer of the cashier (or his small Linux-based PC connected to the hardware, like the RaspberryPi for the POSbox),
* availability of an Ubuntu package, for easier deployment,
* native support for the customer display, payment terminal, etc.
* nice test/diagnosis Web interface.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module,
* go to the menu Point of Sale > Configuration > Point of Sale
* edit the point of sale for which you want to enable the LED:

* In the IotBox section, activate the option *LED Customer Display*,
* configure the format of your LED screen. (2 lines of 20 characters, by default)

* optionaly, you can customize the *Next customer* message and the *POS closed* message

Usage
=====

Once everything is configured, just start the POS as usual. You will see messages on the device when:

* you start the POS,
* you add or remove a product,
* you select or deselect a customer,
* you press the Payment button: the device will display the total amount,
* you enter the amount of cash you receive: the device will display the amount of the change to give back,
* you validate an order and go to the next customer,
* you close the POS.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Support other format, for exemple, 4 lines of 30 characters, for the Bixolon BDC-2000.
