POS Order Load and Save
=======================

This module allows to:
* save a PoS order from PoS front UI to PoS back UI (server);
* recover (load) a draft PoS Order from PoS back UI to PoS front UI;
In this version, when the order is loaded again, the draft order is unlinked
in the server (in database);
