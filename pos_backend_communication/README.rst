POS Backend Communication
=========================

Communicate with the backend from point of sale.

Common use case:

 - a click on a button on the pos opens the backend in a popup to a specific view.
 - a click on a button on the backend's view send to pos some interesting data.

Implementations
---------------

pos_backend_partner: select a pos customer from the backend


Configuration
=============

No configuration is needed.

Developper Guide
================

The POS communicate with subpages (popups) with window.open and window.postMessage. 

Popups are in not-so-old browsers opened in tabs.

When a backend page is open, a class is set on body to hide menus.


Roadmap
=======

- Improve origin verificiation
- Try to use frames instead of popups
- Use notifications for supported browsers

Known limitation
================

- It doesn't work offline.
