Configuration
=============

In some cases, you may want to block the possibility to allow negative quantity
in a PoS Order, without mentioning initial order. This can happen for special
products like returnable products, etc.

In that case, a checkbox is possible on Product Form View to allow such case

Usage
=====

Select an PoS Order an choose either *Return Products* (full return of the
order) or *Partial Return*. In this case, a wizard allows to select just some
products and quantities to return:

Register the refund payment to finish the return. If the original order was
invoiced, a refund invoice will be made.

**Implemented Constraints**

* User can not return more products than the initial quantity:

* If a line has been partially refund, only a reduced quantity can be returned:

* It is not possible to set a negative quantity if the initial Pos Order is
  not indicated:
