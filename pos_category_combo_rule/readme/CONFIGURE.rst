On **Point of Sale > Settings > Combo Rules**, you can create rules to apply discounts on certain items, based on their categories.\

In this model you are able to create multiple rules items, where you select the categories you want to complement the rule, and the amount of discount that product would receive.\

Some considerations: \

- Every rule item work together, and the rule will only be applied when every item is satisfied. \
- If you select multiple categories on the same item, it will consider any of the categories selected to satisfy the item. \
-  If you specify a discount and it happened to be greater than the product's price, it simply will not apply any discount to that product, but it will count for the rule. \

After you configure the rules, go to POS and insert items from the categories selected. When you insert enough items to satisfy all the rule items, every item that is part of the combo will receive the configured discount automatically.
