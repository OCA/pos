On POS Settings, you can configure the source location and the scrap location for the stock scrap. If not configured, it will assume the default locations.

You can also create reason codes for the stock scrap on: Inventory > Settings > Scrap Reason Codes.
if there is any reason configured, a selection with the reasons will be displayed in the popup.
