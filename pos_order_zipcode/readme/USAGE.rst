In point of sale while collect customer payment you
are able to collect its zip code.

Clicking on the *Zip Code* button this will open a form to
collect customer zip code.

If a customer with a zip code is used that value is used as
default value. However edit the POS order zip code won't change
customer zip code.

If catchment area required is set on the POS configuration and try
to validate the payment without POS order zip code the zip code
form will ask cashier to collect it.
