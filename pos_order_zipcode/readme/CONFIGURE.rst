If you have multiple Point Of Sales and some of them do not require
to get catchment area information you can un-check the 
*Catchment area info required* Boolean in the Point Of Sale
Configuration.

..note::

    If you haven't any hard keyboard or numpad connected to
    your iot box you should probably active the virtual keyboard
    in the pos configuration as well.
