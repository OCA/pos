Collect POS customer zip code to determine the catchment area.

This module add zip code field on POS order. POS sessions that require
catchment area will add an extra check before validate the payment
to ensure a zip code has been collected. If cashier choose a partner
or update its zip code this will set the pos order zip code.

Configuration
=============


If you have multiple Point Of Sales and some of them do not require
to get catchment area information you can un-check the 
*Catchment area info required* Boolean in the Point Of Sale
Configuration.

..note::

    If you haven't any hard keyboard or numpad connected to
    your iot box you should probably active the virtual keyboard
    in the pos configuration as well.

Usage
=====

In point of sale while collect customer payment you
are able to collect its zip code.

Clicking on the *Zip Code* button this will open a form to
collect customer zip code.

If a customer with a zip code is used that value is used as
default value. However edit the POS order zip code won't change
customer zip code.

If catchment area required is set on the POS configuration and try
to validate the payment without POS order zip code the zip code
form will ask cashier to collect it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add a button to let cashier to bypass the zip code information
  in case customer don't want to gives that information.
