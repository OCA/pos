This module allows to make payments with a Cashdro (https://www.cashdro.com) terminal
on the Point of Sale frontend.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a Point of Sale cash payment method or create a new one.
#. In the Point of Sale tab, set *Cashdro Payment Terminal* on.
#. Configure the Cashdro terminal hostname and credentials.
#. Configure the desired, Cashdro terminal in the proper PoS configurations.

Note that if a single payment method was used for cash in different stores, it should
be splitted in as many phisical stores there are.

Usage
=====

With the proper configuration made:

#. Make a new PoS order and choose the cash payment method configured with the Cashdro
   settings.
#. In the payment line, tap on the Cashdro request button (the one with a bill icon).
#. The request is sent to the Cashdro terminal that will ask the customer for the amount
   to pay.
#. In this moment, a button with a ban icon will appear. It allows the cashier to cancel
   the request before the payment is made.
#. When the customer pays the sale amount in the terminal, the Cashdro reports the
   amount received and change delivered back.
#. The Point of Sale reflects it in the payment line and thus the order can be validated
   now.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Cashdro terminals are designed to communicate in the local network, so they can't
  receive or transmit any request to a remote Odoo server. So in order to implement
  further features, la cash control or cash ins/outs it would be necessary to either:

  - Prepare the Cashdro terminal for a remote use (VPN, dns, etc.) and implement the
    corresponding backend methods.
  - Develope PoS frontend modules that allow to perform such operations and extend this
    one making use of them.
