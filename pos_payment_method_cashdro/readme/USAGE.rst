With the proper configuration made:

#. Make a new PoS order and choose the cash payment method configured with the Cashdro
   settings.
#. In the payment line, tap on the Cashdro request button (the one with a bill icon).
#. The request is sent to the Cashdro terminal that will ask the customer for the amount
   to pay.
#. In this moment, a button with a ban icon will appear. It allows the cashier to cancel
   the request before the payment is made.
#. When the customer pays the sale amount in the terminal, the Cashdro reports the
   amount received and change delivered back.
#. The Point of Sale reflects it in the payment line and thus the order can be validated
   now.
