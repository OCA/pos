With the proper configuration made:

#. Make a new PoS order and choose the cash payment method configured with the Cashdro
   settings.
#. Click on *Send* to send the request to the Cashdro terminal that will ask the
   customer for the amount to pay.
#. The cashier can cancel the amount request discarding the line clicking on the (x)
   symbol.
#. When the customer pays the sale amount in the terminal, the Cashdro reports the
   amount received and change delivered back.
#. The Point of Sale reflects it in the payment line and thus the order can be validated
   now.
