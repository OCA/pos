With the proper configuration made:

1.  Make a new PoS order and choose the cash payment method configured
    with the Cashdro settings.
2.  Click on *Send* to send the request to the Cashdro terminal that
    will ask the customer for the amount to pay.
3.  The cashier can cancel the amount request discarding the line
    clicking on the (x) symbol.
4.  When the customer pays the sale amount in the terminal, the Cashdro
    reports the amount received and change delivered back.
5.  The Point of Sale reflects it in the payment line and thus the order
    can be validated now.
