To add a Cashdro payment terminal:

#. Go to *Point of Sale > Configuration > Payment Methods*
#. Choose a cash payment method or create a new one.
#. Select *Cashdro* in the *Use a Payment Terminal* field.
#. Configure the Cashdro terminal hostname and credentials.
#. Configure the desired, Cashdro terminal in the proper PoS configurations.

Note that if a single payment method was used for cash in different stores, it should
be splitted in as many phisical stores there are.
