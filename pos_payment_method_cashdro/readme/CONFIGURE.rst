To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a Point of Sale cash payment method or create a new one.
#. In the Point of Sale tab, set *Cashdro Payment Terminal* on.
#. Configure the Cashdro terminal hostname and credentials.
#. Configure the desired, Cashdro terminal in the proper PoS configurations.

Note that if a single payment method was used for cash in different stores, it should
be splitted in as many phisical stores there are.
