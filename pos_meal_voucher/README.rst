* configures your Account journals, mentioning the type of Meal Voucher:

- Paper : the journal will be used when scanning meal voucher barcodes
- Dematerialized: the journal will be used for dematerialized meal vouchers
- Mixed: Specific configuration if your accountant want to use a single journal for Credit card AND dematerialized meal vouchers. In that case, the button of this journal will be duplicated, and an extra text can be set to display an alternative label.

Usage
=====

* Open your Point of Sale

* Cashier can see the food products, eligible for meal voucher payment, and see the total for
  Meal Voucher amount

  .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/front_ui_pos_order_screen.png

* go to the payment screen

A Meal Voucher Summary is available:

  .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/front_ui_pos_payment_screen.png

If the amount received is too important, a warning icon is displayed

  .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/front_ui_pos_payment_screen_summary.png

If the cashier try to validate the order, a warning is also display, asking confirmation

  .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/12.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/front_ui_pos_payment_screen_warning.png

It is a non blocking warning, because we don't want to prevent an order to be done,
if products are not correctly set, or if a recent law changed the maximum amount that can
be used each day. (A recent case occured in France, during the Covid-19 pandemy)

Note
~~~~

A new barcode rule is available for Paper Meal Voucher of 24 chars:

``...........{NNNDD}........``

If you scan the following barcode ``052566641320080017000000``, a new payment line will be added, with an amount of 8,00€ (``00800``)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Introduce the Meal Voucher Issuer model
* When scaning Meal Voucher, deduce the Issuer
* Add a reporting to make easily the deposit of Meal Vouchers, per issuers.
* Add an option to add subtotal of products that can be paid with meal vouchers,
  on the bill.
* Prevent to scan twice the same Meal Voucher barcode.
