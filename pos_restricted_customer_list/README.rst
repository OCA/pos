In the point of sale, many installations work with cash registers with
anonymous customers. In that case, loading thousands, or even tens of
thousands of customers to each cash register is completely useless, and also
a huge danger for leaking privacy sensible data.

This module will limit the download of customer data to only those customers
where this has been specifically requested.

Usage
=====

To allow a customer to be displayed in the PoS, just check the 'Available in POS' field.

Development
===========

The module will add a flag 'available_in_pos' to res.partner. It will override
to domain of customers downloaded with pos to only download the partners
where this flag has been set.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

I see two obvious extensions to the functionality already developed:
1. Add back on demand customer lookup (only when online);
2. Make customers available to pos, dependent on the pos session or user.
In pos.config or res.users (or both) there could be a selection field customer_loading with values:

 - 'no_one': disable customer loading (usefull for self service pos, without customer feature)
 - 'selection': the feature now implemented (load only checked customers) (default value)
 - 'all': for super cashier, (after sale PoS), etc.
